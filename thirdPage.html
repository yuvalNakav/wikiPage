        <h1 id="pageheadline">Ethics</h1>
            <p>Kant's <em>ethical philosophy</em> can be reduced to <b>one</b> sentence: </br> "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law".
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Central to Kant's construction of the moral law is the categorical imperative, which acts on all people, regardless of their interests or desires. Kant formulated the categorical imperative in various ways. His principle of universalizability requires that, for an action to be permissible, it must be possible to apply it to all people without a contradiction occurring. Kant's formulation of humanity, the second section of the categorical imperative, states that as an end in itself, humans are required never to treat others merely as a means to an end, but always as ends in themselves. The formulation of autonomy concludes that rational agents are bound to the moral law by their own will, while Kant's concept of the Kingdom of Ends requires that people act as if the principles of their actions establish a law for a hypothetical kingdom. Kant also distinguished between perfect and imperfect duties. Kant used the example of lying as an application of his ethics: because there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, we must never lie, even if it seems that lying would bring about better consequences than telling the truth. Likewise, a perfect duty (e.g. the duty not to lie) always holds true; an imperfect duty (e.g., the duty to give to charity) can be made flexible and applied in particular time and place.</p>
